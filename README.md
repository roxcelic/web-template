## hey!

I have made this 'templete' for my website because when i first started off making websites i had no clue where to start or where to go from So i plan to update this repo with a basic and content eaten templete for my websites. With them being open source anyways it would be pretty easy to 'steal' anyways so i guess im just making the process a lot more streamline.

To use this all you need to do is setup a node.js project and clone this repo into it, but i guess if your reading this then you wont know how to do that.
Simply download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)

cool youre half way there! 
next, download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is a version controll system, [here is a blog post](https://marsh.zone/blog/2024/06/git-gud/) by one of my friends explaing it much better than i ever could.

(remeber to set up git before continuting, my friends blog post explains how to do this)

Finally in a terminal wherever you want to make your website (file location wise) run the following commands:
```sh
npm create astro@latest
#fill out as you need or would like, just go with the defaults if you dont understand
git clone https://github.com/roxcelic/web-template/tree/siteV3
cd web-template
